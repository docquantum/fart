~~**F**\*\*\*\*ing~~ **F**reaking **A**wful **R**ay **T**racer

This is my awful ray tracer. Based on the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book series you can also follow along [here](https://raytracing.github.io/).

I'm trying my best to ignore the code and make my own stuff from scratch using C++11 standards.

Other resources that will be referenced are various stack overflow posts and geeks for geeks articles when it comes to specific C++ semantics.

The target OS is Linux, but I will aim to make it compatible with MSVC in Windows.

GPLv3 cuz my stuff is your stuff and everyone elses, but *I* made it (with some help).
